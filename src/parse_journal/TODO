1. better to just remove all files from the previous run
when --clean flag is passed -- rather than files and directories

2. Find a good way to remove journal entries that look like:
This CaringBridge site was created just recently. Please visit again soon for a journal update.
DONE

3. Concatenate titles into the journal body's text.
DONE

4. Write a test to make sure parse_manager.py's method check_file_splits
   calls the file splitter at the appropriate time. Checking that the file
   splits are correct is already tested in test_split_file.py

5. There might still be folders for sites even when all journals for that
site were deleted (or we're skipping them because it's just the default journal
entry). This might cause a bug later. Should delete these empty site folders
at the end of the parse_manager, or should perform some check to not create them,
i think the first option is easiest.
